    "\n",
    "* 1: Remove all the HTML tags in the third review, by creating a beatifulsoup object and then using the `.text` method. Save results in variable `review3`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* 2: Import NLTK's sent_tokenizer and count the number of sentences in review 3 (cleaned from HTML tags). To import sent_tokenizer use: `from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* 3: Remove all punctuation, numbers and special characters from the third review (cleaned from HTML tags). We can do this using Regular Expression - package `re`. Save the results in variable `review3`. Code given to you as we haven't covered this in class:\n",
    "\n",
    "        review3 = re.sub('[^a-zA-Z]',' ',review3)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* 4: Convert all the letters to lower case (save in variable `review3`). Then split the string so that every word is one element in a list (save the list in variable `review3_words`). Note: When we split the strings into words that process is called tokenization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* 5: Use NLTK's PorterStemmer (`from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer`). Create a new Porter stemmer (`stemmer = PorterStemmer()`) and run it on every word in `review3_words`, print the results as one string (don't overwrite the `review3_words` variable from 4). What does the PorterStemmer do?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* 6: Now we want to Part Of Speech (POS)) tag the third movie review. We will use POS labeling also called grammatical tagging. To do this import `from nltk.tag import pos_tag`. When you use pos_tag on a word it returns a token-tag pair in the form of a tuple. In NLTK's Penn Treebank POS, the abbreviation (tag) for an adjective is JJ and NN for singular nouns. Count the number of singular nouns (NN) and adjectives (JJ) in `review3_words` using NLTK's pos_tag_sents. A list of the Penn Treebank pos_tag's can be found here: http://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* 7: An even more sophisticated operation than stemming using the PorterStemmer is called lemmatizing. Lemmatizing, in contrast to stemming, does not create non-existent words and converts words to their synonyms. In order to use lemmatizing we need to define the wordnet POS tag. A function that takes in a POS Penn Treebank tag and converts it to a wordnet tag and then lemmatizes words in a string has been given to you below. Please extend this code and print the lemmatized third movie review. Don't save the results in any variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* 8: Lastly we will try to remove common words that don't carry much information. These are called stopwords. In English they could for example be 'am', 'are', 'and' etc. To import NLTK's list of stopwords you need to download the stopword corpora (`import nltk` and then `nltk.download()` if you don't have it). When that is done run `from nltk.corpus import stopwords` and create a variable for English stopwords with `eng_stopwords = stopwords.words('english')`. Use the list of English stopwords to remove all the stopwords from your list of words in the third movie review, i.e. `review3_words`. Print `review3_words` without stopwords, count the number of stopwords removed and print them as well."

       "'\"The film starts with a manager (Nicholas Bell) giving welcome investors (Robert Carradine) to Primal Park . A secret project mutating a primal animal using fossilized DNA, like ¨Jurassik Park¨, and some scientists resurrect one of nature\\'s most fearsome predators, the Sabretooth tiger or Smilodon . Scientific ambition turns deadly, however, and when the high voltage fence is opened the creature escape and begins savagely stalking its prey - the human visitors , tourists and scientific.Meanwhile some youngsters enter in the restricted area of the security center and are attacked by a pack of large pre-historical animals which are deadlier and bigger . In addition , a security agent (Stacy Haiduk) and her mate (Brian Wimmer) fight hardly against the carnivorous Smilodons. The Sabretooths, themselves , of course, are the real star stars and they are astounding terrifyingly though not convincing. The giant animals savagely are stalking its prey and the group run afoul and fight against one nature\\'s most fearsome predators. Furthermore a third Sabretooth more dangerous and slow stalks its victims.The movie delivers the goods with lots of blood and gore as beheading, hair-raising chills,full of scares when the Sabretooths appear with mediocre special effects.The story provides exciting and stirring entertainment but it results to be quite boring .The giant animals are majority made by computer generator and seem totally lousy .Middling performances though the players reacting appropriately to becoming food.Actors give vigorously physical performances dodging the beasts ,running,bound and leaps or dangling over walls . And it packs a ridiculous final deadly scene. No for small kids by realistic,gory and violent attack scenes . Other films about Sabretooths or Smilodon are the following : ¨Sabretooth(2002)¨by James R Hickox with Vanessa Angel, David Keith and John Rhys Davies and the much better ¨10.000 BC(2006)¨ by Roland Emmerich with with Steven Strait, Cliff Curtis and Camilla Belle. This motion picture filled with bloody moments is badly directed by George Miller and with no originality because takes too many elements from previous films. Miller is an Australian director usually working for television (Tidal wave, Journey to the center of the earth, and many others) and occasionally for cinema ( The man from Snowy river, Zeus and Roxanne,Robinson Crusoe ). Rating : Below average, bottom of barrel.\"'"

    "# Q1:4: Feature vectors and Bag of Words model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "Derived from source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial/details/part-1-for-beginners-bag-of-words\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now use scikit-learn to create numeric representations of the words in the reviews, using a method called Bag of Words. You can see this as learning a vocabulary from all the reviews and counting how many times a word appears in the reviews. For example, if we have two sentences:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sentence 1:** \"cool students study cool data science\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sentence 2:** \"to know data science study data science\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The vocabulary of these two sentences can be summarized in a dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "{ cool, students, study, data, science, to, know }\n",
    "\n",
    "The bags of words count the number of times each word occur in a sentence. In Sentence 1, \"cool\" appears twice, and \"students\", \"study\", \"data\", and \"science\" appear once. The feature vector for Sentence 1 is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 1: { 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0 }\n",
    "\n",
    "And for Sentence 2: { 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1}\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applying this strategy to the IMDB movie reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "The movie review data contains a lot of words. To limit the analysis we use the 5000 most frequent words from the cleaned reviews. To extract the bag of words features we will use scitkit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training data will be created by the `CountVectorizer` function from scikit-learn, and the training array will have 25000 rows (one for each review) and 5000 features (one for each vocabulary word).\n",
    "\n",
    "CountVectorizer can automatically handle text cleaning, but here we specify \"None\", instead we did a step-by-step cleaning of the data in the earlier problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Random Forest for review sentiment classification\n",
    "\n",
    "First split up the data set so that 80% are used as training samples (the first 20000 reviews and their sentiment) and 20% are used as validation samples (the last 5000 reviews and their sentiment). Use Random Forest to do numeric training on the features for the training samples from the Bag of Words and their respective sentiment labels for each review / feature vector. The number of trees is set to 50 as a default value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1: Run this analysis for the three cleaned review lists, i.e. `review_clean_original`, `review_clean_ps` and `review_clean_wnl`, by using the code below. Extend the function to print the **validation accuracy** by using `forest.predict(train_data_features[20000:,:])` and then comparing the resulting sentiment predictions with the ones stored in `train[\"sentiment\"][20000:]`. **Note:** The printed validation accuracy should show the percentage of correctly predicted sentiments for the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* 2: Print the validation accuracy obtained for the three models. **Note:** Takes about 4mins to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* 3: What data preprocessing strategy worked the best? Why do you think that is? (Feel free to change the number of features extracted in the bag of words model and the number of trees in the random forest model, to see how it effects your accuracy)."
